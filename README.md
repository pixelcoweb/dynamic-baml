- **Robust Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started quickly.

## Installation

To install the Dynamic BAML library, use pip:

```bash
pip install dynamic-baml
```

After installation, you can verify it by running:

```bash
python -c "import dynamic_baml; print(dynamic_baml.__version__)"
```

## Usage

Dynamic BAML offers a straightforward API for generating BAML schemas and extracting structured data. Below is a simple example of how to use the library.

### Basic Example

```python
from dynamic_baml import BAMLGenerator

# Initialize the BAML generator
generator = BAMLGenerator()

# Generate a BAML schema
schema = generator.generate_schema(data_source="your_data_source")

# Output the generated schema
print(schema)
```

### Structured Data Extraction

You can also use Dynamic BAML to extract structured data using your preferred LLM model.

```python
from dynamic_baml import DataExtractor

# Initialize the data extractor
extractor = DataExtractor(model="openai")

# Extract structured data
structured_data = extractor.extract(data="your_raw_data")

# Output the structured data
print(structured_data)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Generating a BAML Schema

```python
from dynamic_baml import BAMLGenerator

data_source = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "occupation": "Software Developer"
}

generator = BAMLGenerator()
schema = generator.generate_schema(data_source=data_source)

print("Generated BAML Schema:")
print(schema)
```

### Example 2: Extracting Structured Data

```python
from dynamic_baml import DataExtractor

raw_data = "John Doe is a 30-year-old Software Developer."

extractor = DataExtractor(model="anthropic")
structured_data = extractor.extract(data=raw_data)

print("Extracted Structured Data:")
print(structured_data)
```
